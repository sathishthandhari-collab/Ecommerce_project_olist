## ðŸ“‹ Interview Preparation Strategy

### Phase 1: Technical Foundation Questions

#### **Snowflake Expertise** 
*Expected questions and your answers:*

**Q: "Explain Snowflake's architecture and how it differs from traditional data warehouses."**

**A**: "Snowflake uses a unique multi-cluster, shared-data architecture with three key layers:
- **Storage Layer**: Data stored in cloud storage, automatically compressed and encrypted
- **Compute Layer**: Virtual warehouses that can scale independently 
- **Services Layer**: Query optimization, metadata management, security

Key differentiators: 
- **Separation of compute and storage** allows independent scaling
- **Multi-cluster architecture** prevents resource contention
- **Automatic clustering and optimization** 
- **Time travel and zero-copy cloning** for data versioning

In my Olist project, I leveraged clustering on high-cardinality dimensions like customer_state and report_date for optimal query performance."

**Q: "How do you optimize Snowflake costs?"**

**A**: "I implement several cost optimization strategies:
- **Right-sizing warehouses** based on workload requirements
- **Auto-suspend and resume** to minimize idle compute time  
- **Clustering keys** on frequently filtered columns
- **Incremental processing** to minimize data scanning
- **Development sampling** to reduce compute in non-prod environments
- **Query result caching** for repeated analytical queries

In my dbt project, I built a cost monitoring macro that tracks credits used, execution time, and cost per row for each model, helping identify optimization opportunities."

#### **dbt Development Mastery**

**Q: "Walk me through your dbt project architecture and design decisions."**

**A**: "My Olist project follows a three-layer medallion architecture:

**Staging Layer (8 models)**: Raw data standardization with data quality scoring, timezone conversion, and surrogate key generation. I use incremental materialization with merge strategy for efficiency.

**Intermediate Layer (4 models)**: Business logic implementation including customer 360-degree profiling, CLV prediction, anomaly detection, and seller health scoring. These use delete+insert strategy for accuracy.

**Marts Layer (8 models)**: Executive and operational reporting optimized for BI tools. Table materialization with clustering for performance.

**Key design decisions**:
- **Environment-specific configs**: Dev uses sampled data (10K rows) for faster iteration
- **Custom macros** for reusable business logic like Z-score calculation and data quality scoring  
- **Schema contracts** on executive marts for downstream stability
- **Advanced testing** with custom expectations for anomaly detection"

**Q: "How do you handle incremental processing and data quality?"**

**A**: "For incremental processing:
- **Smart refresh logic** using `is_incremental()` with lookback windows
- **Delete+insert strategy** for models needing complete refresh of changed records
- **Merge strategy** for append-only data like orders and payments
- **Custom macros** to get related IDs for incremental updates

For data quality:
- **Automated quality scoring** macro that calculates percentage of passed checks
- **Quality thresholds** (80% minimum) with automatic filtering
- **Statistical anomaly detection** using configurable Z-score thresholds
- **Contract enforcement** on critical business tables
- **Advanced testing** including referential integrity and business logic validation"

#### **Python & Advanced Analytics**

**Q: "Describe your approach to customer segmentation and churn prediction."**

**A**: "In my customer 360 model, I implement:

**RFM Segmentation**:
```sql
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY days_since_last_order DESC) AS recency_score,
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY total_orders ASC) AS frequency_score,  
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent ASC) AS monetary_score
```

**Lifecycle Staging**: Champions, Loyalists, Potential Loyalists, At-Risk, Lost based on recency and frequency patterns.

**Churn Probability**: Simplified logistic regression in SQL:
```sql
1 / (1 + EXP(-(-2.5 + days_since_last_order * 0.01 - total_orders * 0.3)))
```

**Validation**: I validate models using holdout sets and track prediction accuracy over time. Python would be used for more sophisticated ML models with sklearn for production deployment."

### Phase 2: Advanced Technical Questions

#### **Analytics Engineering Best Practices**

**Q: "How do you ensure your data models are production-ready?"**

**A**: "My production-readiness checklist includes:

**Performance**: 
- Clustering on query patterns, incremental processing, cost monitoring per model

**Reliability**: 
- Comprehensive testing (nulls, uniqueness, relationships, business logic)
- Data quality thresholds with automatic filtering
- Schema contracts for breaking change prevention

**Observability**: 
- Run cost tracking, execution time monitoring, automated alerting on failures
- Data lineage documentation with business context

**Maintainability**: 
- Modular design with reusable macros, clear naming conventions
- Environment-specific configurations (dev sampling vs prod full data)
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment

**Documentation**: Business glossary, metric definitions, model dependencies clearly documented"

**Q: "Describe your approach to performance optimization."**

**A**: "Multi-layered optimization strategy:

**Query Level**: 
- Appropriate clustering keys, efficient join patterns, predicate pushdown optimization

**Model Level**: 
- Right materialization strategy (incremental vs table vs view)
- Partition pruning with date ranges, selective column loading

**Warehouse Level**: 
- Auto-scaling based on workload, warehouse sizing optimization
- Resource monitoring with automatic alerts

**Development Process**: 
- Cost tracking per model execution, query plan analysis
- Development sampling to reduce iteration time
- Incremental-first mindset to minimize data scanning"

### Phase 3: Business Acumen Questions

**Q: "How would you design KPIs for an e-commerce executive team?"**

**A**: "For executive reporting, I focus on actionable metrics with clear business impact:

**Growth Metrics**: GMV growth (MoM, YoY), customer acquisition rate, market expansion
**Unit Economics**: Customer LTV, acquisition cost, average order value trends  
**Health Indicators**: Customer satisfaction scores, seller marketplace health, payment success rates
**Leading Indicators**: New customer conversion, repeat purchase rates, churn risk scoring
**Operational Efficiency**: Delivery performance, fraud detection accuracy, cost per transaction

Key design principles:
- **Automated alerting** for metric thresholds
- **Trend analysis** with statistical significance testing
- **Drill-down capability** from executive summary to operational detail
- **Confidence intervals** for predictive metrics like CLV"

### Phase 4: Scenario-Based Questions

**Q: "A stakeholder reports that customer LTV numbers look wrong. How do you investigate?"**

**A**: "Systematic troubleshooting approach:

**1. Data Investigation**:
- Check recent data loads for completeness and freshness
- Validate source data quality scores and anomaly detection alerts
- Compare period-over-period for unusual patterns

**2. Logic Validation**:
- Review CLV calculation methodology and business assumptions
- Check for edge cases in customer segmentation logic
- Validate cohort definitions and timeframes

**3. Stakeholder Alignment**:
- Confirm business definition of LTV matches technical implementation
- Understand expected values and compare with calculated results
- Document any business rule changes needed

**4. Resolution**:
- Implement fixes with proper testing, update documentation
- Add additional validation tests to prevent future issues
- Communicate changes and timeline to stakeholders"
